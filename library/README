To build the code in this library, enter the directory build and then type "cmake .."
Then type make in the build directory and the shared library libEBBLibrary.so should be
built. The example programs in the exploringBB repository expect the shared library to
be in the /exploringBB/library directory, so move it from the library/build directory
to the parent directory. 

The parent directory /exploringBB/library currently contains a shared (.so) and statically
linked version (.a) of the library. See the examples on how to use this library. For 
example see exploringBB/chp09/LCDcharacter/build, which contains:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/libEBBLibrary.so -o LCDApp -I "../../library"

You can also use the static library by typing:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/libEBBLibrary.a -o LCDApp -I "../../library"
